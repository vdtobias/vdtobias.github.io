```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
data(cars)
```

## This is a test page

I'm checking ot see how this works on github.io. 
We'll keep the default example to see how it goes.

### Simple summary stats

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
